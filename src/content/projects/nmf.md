## Description
This repository contains an implementation of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm using Alternating Least Square (ALS) with Python. The implementation is based on the paper [Algorithms for Non-negative Matrix Factorization](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1861-algorithms-for-non-negative-matrix-factorization.pdf) by Daniel D. Lee and H. Sebastian Seung. Inspired while taking the Linear Algebra for Computation course.
